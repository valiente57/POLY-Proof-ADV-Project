## Description

In this project, photos produced by Bing AI are used to install a 5-item NFT collection. A Goerli Ethereum Testnet ERC721A contract is deployed, and the NFTs are saved on IPFS using pinata.cloud. Functionalities like minting, transferring, and mapping the NFTs are included in the contract.

## Getting Started
